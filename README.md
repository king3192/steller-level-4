Settle, split, and manage rent payments with inter-communicating smart contracts.

RentStar is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to simplify rent and utility settlements between roommates. Powered by the high-speed, low-fee Stellar Testnet blockchain, RentStar integrates **Soroban Rust Smart Contracts** to split rent pools on-chain, manage roommate registry allocations, and support **multiple Stellar wallets** for frictionless roommate settlement.

## 🛠️ Key Upgrade Features

- **Multi-Contract Architecture**: 
  - **`RoomManager` Contract**: Houses roommate addresses, rent shares, payment histories, and access controls.
  - **`RentSplit` Contract**: Acts as the payment processor, verifying roommate records and updating balances on the `RoomManager` via cross-contract calls.
- **Landlord Admin Panel**: Landlords can connect their admin wallet to register roommates, assign rent shares, and update the linked `RentSplit` contract.
- **Roommate Stats Dashboard**: Renters get a customized overview of their individual share, payment progress, outstanding balance, and global pool metrics.
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Integrates `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit` to connect to Freighter, xBull, or Albedo browser extension wallets.
- **Demo / Mock Mode & Profile Simulator**: Test the entire landlord and roommate flows (transaction building, signing, submitting, and state updates) with an interactive role-switching utility—no extension installation needed.
- **Real-Time Event Activity Feed**: Background polling of Soroban RPC ledger events decoded from XDR to display a live feed of roommate payment history.
- **Granular State Machine UI**: Upgraded progress loader that visually checks off stages as they happen: `idle` ➔ `building` ➔ `awaiting signature` ➔ `submitting` ➔ `pending` ➔ `success` / `error`.
- **Intelligent Error Classifier**: Maps complex Horizon transaction result codes and Soroban contract panics into clear, friendly error categories.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Node 18+ installed.
2. **Rust & Cargo**: Required to build/run the smart contract tests locally.
3. **Stellar CLI**: Needed to compile/deploy the smart contracts on testnet.

### Installation & Run
1. Clone or copy the project files to your system.
2. Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Run the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` (or the port output by Vite).

## 🧪 Verification & Testing

### 1. Smart Contract Tests
Run the unit and integration tests inside the Rust contracts to verify cross-contract calls, boundary limits, and events:
```bash
# Test RoomManager contract
cd contracts/room_manager
cargo test

# Test RentSplit contract (includes multi-contract integration flow tests)
cd ../rent_split
cargo test
```

### 2. Frontend Local Testing (Demo Mode)
If you don't have wallet extensions installed, click the **Connect Demo Wallet (Mock Mode)**. This will enable:
- A **Simulate Profile** toggle to switch between **Roommate** and **Landlord** accounts.
- **Landlord Flow**: Add roommates, set shares, link contract IDs, and track settlement bars in real-time.
- **Roommate Flow**: Form validation based on outstanding shares, pay rent, and update the live **Recent Activity** event feed.
